    "### Feature Selection and Engineering\n",
    "**Submission guidelines**:\n",
    "<br>In this section students need to decide which features are helpful in predicting the target variable – for example, serial correlation, momentum, technical analysis indicators (such as RSI), and signals from trend-following strategies (such as the moving average crossover).\n",
    "1. Select at least four explanatory variables and perform the necessary transformations so that they are useful in the model phase. You are encouraged to use more than four variables. Investigate feature engineering techniques such as PCA and encoding target variables using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "2. Write a short paragraph about each technique investigated and show an implementation of it in a Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to include references that indicate where the ideas were sourced.\n",
    "3.  At this stage groups should take the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the cross-validation techniques for forecasting financial time series – for example, traditional k-fold cross-validation versus walk forward analysis, and Purged K-Fold CV. Write a short paragraph explaining each technique researched. Research at least three (they don’t have to be the 3 mentioned here)."
